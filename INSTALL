Cloud Sidekick Cato 

------------------------------------------
Installation
------------------------------------------

These installation instructions cover installing Cato on a single linux 
machine with web, database and services residing under the same home 
directory. Other installation options such as a multiple server install
are possible and may be recommended under different circumstances and will 
be covered in future revisions of this document. 

1.  If installing Cato from binaries prebuilt for your linux distribution
and architecture, extract from the tar file into an application directory such
as /opt/cato. 

Note: you will need write privileges in the target directory. 

tar xvzf <cato_tar_file>.tar.gz -C /opt

2. If installing Cato from source, first make sure to perform the build 
instructions located in the web and services directories. After the build 
processes have been completed, run the install script located in the source
root. This install script will copy the appropriate files from the source
directories to the target directory. 

Note: you will need write privileges in the target directory or use sudo
to run the install script. 

	cd <cato source directory>
	chmod +x install.sh
	./install.sh [-s] [-t targetpath] [-c component (web|service|all)

or for interactive installation:

	./install.sh


3. With the binaries in the new cato home, the next step is to create and 
populate the database. Switch to the cato home directory and use the MySql
command line tool to create the database and run the following scripts.

	cd /opt/cato
	
	export CATO_HOME=/opt/cato
	
If MySQL is not installed, install it using the following for Debian / Ubuntu
NOTE: MySQL 5.1 or higher is required for Cato.

	sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Create the database, where username is a database user with CREATE and GRANT 
privileges (typically root).

	mysqladmin -u root -p create cato
	mysql -u root -p


At the MySQL prompt (change password to something appropriate):

NOTE: change the password value below!

	GRANT EXECUTE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE,  
	LOCK TABLES, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON `cato`.* TO 'cato'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	exit

4. Now setup the configuration file that will allow the web and services
to connect to the database. Make a copy of the default conf file and edit
with your favorite tool. 

	cp conf/default.cato.conf conf/cato.conf

	vi conf/cato.conf

Change the database parameter values as appropriate (skip the encryption
key and password for now). Save and quit.

The database password and encryption key values will themselves need to 
be stored in the conf file encrypted. Using the setup_conf script create
the encrypted versions of these values. This script prompts for the 
encryption key, database password and optionally the application
administrator password. 

Make note of the values returned, you will need to paste them into files.
Answer Y when asked if you want to encrypt the application admin password. 

NOTE: this script relies on the CATO_HOME environment variable to be set 
properly. See step number three above. 

	chmod +x conf/setup_conf
	./conf/setup_conf

Reedit the conf file and paste the key and database password values on the
related lines. Save and quit. 

	vi conf/cato.conf


5. Change the application "Administrator" password in the database data script to the 
encrypted value. This was the last value encrypted when the setup_config 
script was run. Replace encryptedpassword in the following command with 
the encrypted Administrator password and run the command.

	sed -i 's/#ADMINPASSWORD#/<password_from_setup_conf>/' data/cato_data.sql

6. Run the following commands to create and populate the database tables. 
Use the super user and password.

	mysql -u root -p cato < ./data/cato_ddl.sql

	mysql -u root -p cato < ./data/cato_data.sql

7. Next perform the web installation. Change to the web directory and view 
the INSTALL there for specific steps for the web component. 

8. After the web install piece has been completed, finish the installation 
process with installing the services component. Change to the services 
directory and view the INSTALL file for specific steps. 
document in the database directory.
