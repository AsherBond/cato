These installation instructions cover installing Cato on a single linux

directory. 

Other installation options such as a multiple server install
are possible and may be recommended under different circumstances and will 
be covered in future revisions of this document. 

Automated install on Ubuntu 10.11 or higher

The following commands will download a bash script which will install Cato CE and all 
non-optional dependencies listed above.  

Edit the installation script to customize the Cato release number, database name, passwords, etc. 

    curl -L --output /tmp/cato_ce_install.sh https://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.cloudsidekick.com/install/cato_ce_install.sh

Edit file to customize here.

    chmod +x /tmp/cato_ce_install.sh
    sudo /tmp/cato_ce_install.sh

This script will start 5 server processes: Poller, Scheduler, Messenger, Ecosync and Admin UI. 

To login to the Cato CE Administrator UI, point your browser to 

    http://<serveraddress>

and login with the user id: administrator
and the password of: password

you will be required to change the password upon initial login.

Verify services are running. 

Now check to see that all processes are running:

    ps -eafl|grep cato_ |grep -v grep

If all five processes are not running, check the logfiles for errors. 

    cd /var/cato/log
    ls -l *.log
    more cato_poller.log

NOTE: if at any time the services need to be shutdown, the following scripts will stop / start 
the processes and also place monitors in cron. 

To stop the services:

    sudo /opt/cato/services/stop_services.sh
    sudo /opt/cato/web/stop_web.sh

Then to start services:

    sudo /opt/cato/services/start_services.sh
    sudo /opt/cato/web/start_web.sh
