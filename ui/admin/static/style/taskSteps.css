/*
 These styles apply specifically to instances of
 specific commands in a task.  (Commands being synonymous
 with 'Step' and 'Function')

 Basically, there is a predefined set of step types.
 Rather than bog down the style sheet for the whole task page with it,
 we're defining them here.

 We are using fn_ as a prefix for all command specific styles.
